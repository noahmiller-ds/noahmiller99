- 👋 Hi, I’m @noahmiller-ds!
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection between high-performance computing and data science/analytics. I like exploring how data science tasks can be accelerated with Python modules such as Numba, Multiprocessing, and, where applicable, both together. I am also teaching myself all about accelerating Python code using NVIDIA's CUDA platform. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about different machine learning algorithms and frameworks in Python, R, and even Julia! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects and how to apply these algorithms to important problems in business, healthcare, AI, and defense.
