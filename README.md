- 👋 Hi, I’m @noahmiller99!
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection between high-performance computing and data science/analytics. I like exploring how data science tasks can be accelerated with Python modules such as Numba, Multiprocessing, and, where applicable, both together. I am also teaching myself all about accelerating Python code using NVIDIA's CUDA platform.
